<!-- HTML file path describes the location of file in a web site's folder structure
Relative file path points to file relative to current page
    -best practice to not bound to current base URL, so link will work on localhost, current & future public domain
src=
image.jpg -file in same folder as current page
images/image.jpg -file in images folder in current folder
/images/image.jpg -file in images folder at the root of current web
../image.jpg -file in folder one level up from current folder
used to link external file: web page, image, style sheet, JavaScript
Absolute file path is full URL to file: src=https://www.com/images/image.jpg
